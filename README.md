# form_print
Form_print is a simple form application that takes a scanned Visa application form and sets it as a background image to an HTML form that has invisible inputs. Users fill information in those inputs and press the submit button, which in turn stores the data with a timestamp into the local storage. The list of entries of the local storage are shown under the main form and clicking on any of those entries retrieves the data of that entry and displays it on each of the respective inputs. Thus a CRUD is formed that also has a print button that formats the data according to the page size.
